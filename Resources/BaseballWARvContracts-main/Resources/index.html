                  The dataset for this visualization is from <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">Citi Bike</a>.
                  The visualization includes Citi Bike usage data from October 2019 to September 2020. There were over 18 million rows of data initially, but Tableau only 
                  allows 15 million rows of data. Hence, only the data of Annual member (Subscriber) was included in the visualization. All 12-month data files were compiled into 2 file (Pre-COVID19 & COVID19) using Python.

                  <strong>Total Number of Trips</strong> - Prior to the 1st confirmed COVID-19 case in the state of New York, the number of trips taken
                  constantly decreases by over 25% from October to December. This correlates with the decrease in the weather temperatue, which indicates that the weather
                  temperature has an impact on the number of trips taken by the annual members. The number of trips taken, however, increases by about 30%
                  in January before dropping again in Febrauary. This could be due to the temperature fluctuation during the month of January or/and
                  the end of holiday season where roads are not bustling with crowds of pedestrian from various events. </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  As the weather enters the spring season, we would expect the number of trips to rise with the nicer outdoor temperature. However, the number of trips
                  steadily drops from January 2020, with a dramatic drop of about 43% in April compared to March. The 1st confirmed positive COVID-19 case occurs on 
                  March 1, 2019. The state of New York quickly turns into an epicenter of COVID-19 where positive cases rapidly rises each day. With 
                  various executive orders from the governor, a lot of companies ask employee to start working from home. Surprisingly, though most of the companies
                  have not allowed employees to return to office, the number of trips taken sees a surge in May. This is likely due to previously closed business back in April
                  has reopened and the previous executive orders start relaxing. The number of trips taken after the pandemic hits almost normalizes as what
                  is seen back in October 2019.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                  Note that there is a slight variation in the number of trips taken between the weekdays and the weekend after the 
                  pandemic occurs, as opposed to prior to the pandemic where the number of trips is generally higher during the weekdays.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  <strong>Subscribers Demographic</strong> - There seems to be no difference in the distribution of gender and age group of the subscribers before or after the pandemic occurs.
                  Generally, there are more male subscribers compared to female subscribers given at any month. The majority of the subscriber
                  is within the age range of mid-20s to mid-30s. Again, the same observation is seen regardless of whether it is prior or during the pandemic.</p>
